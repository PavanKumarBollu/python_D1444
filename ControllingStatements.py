"""
when you want to control the flow of execution inside the program we need the help of the controlling statements
Ex : if you have 1000 lines of code inside the program always the execution will not be from top to bottom some times
we need to execute some lines of code repeatedly and some lines of code will be skipped.. etc


types of controlling statements in python
----------------------------------------
1. conditional statements
2. iterative (looping or control) statements
3. transfer statement

"""

"""
1. conditional statements
    1. if 
    2. if-elif
    3. if-elif-else
    4. switch -> there is not switch concept available in python
    
    
2. iterative (looping or control) statements
    1. for 
    2. while
    3. do-while -> we don't have the concept of do-while in python
    
3. transfer statement 
    1. continue
    2. break
