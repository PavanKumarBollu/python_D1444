"""
string is a datatype in python which is used to store the sequence of characters or collection of characters
it built in data type -- it store all types of values or textual data

to store something inside a string we need to use either single or double quotes ('' ,"")





"""

#Examples
# string_single = 'here is the single quote string'
# string_double = "here is the double quote string"
# multi_line_string = """
# this is a multi line string
# used to store the multiple lines of string
# """
# print(string_single)
# print(string_double)
# print(multi_line_string)


#accesing the string
"""
in python we can access the individual characters form a string 
"""

# movie = "Iron Man"

# #accessing the first character
# first_char = movie[0]

#
# #negative indexing
#
# last_char = movie[-1]
# print(last_char)
#
# last_second_char = movie[-2]
# print(last_second_char)

#slicing -> slicing allows us to extract the portion of the string , we can specify start and end index, step up value


# i_name = "ANUDIP FOUNDATION MADHAPUR"
#
# #SLICING TO GET ONLY ANUDIP FORM i_name
# first_name = i_name[0:7]#ANUDIP

# #SLICING TO GET ONLY FOUNDATION  FORM i_name
# mid_name = i_name[7:17]
# print(mid_name)
#
# step_up = i_name[::2]
#
# print(step_up)#AUI ONAINMDAU


#string length to find the total number of characters present inside the string we can use len() function
# i_name = "ANUDIP FOUNDATION MADHAPUR"#26

# total_char = len(i_name)

#iterating over a string
